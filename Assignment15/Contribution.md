## üß© Contribution Strategy

### üü° Phase 1: Documentation & Setup
- Begin with small tasks like fixing typos, updating READMEs, and improving CONTRIBUTING.md files.
- Verify setup by cloning each repo, building locally, and running test suites.

### üîµ Phase 2: Bug Fixes & Testing
- Pick one `good-first-issue` per project to fix and submit a PR.
- Focus on tasks like adding unit tests and fixing error-handling logic.

### üü¢ Phase 3: Enhancements
- Collaborate on `help-wanted` issues like pagination, Swagger annotations, or feature enhancements.
- Leave a comment like _"I'd like to work on this"_ to avoid overlap with other contributors.
